## 💡 CONCLUSION

Our current POS implementation is a **solid foundation** but is only about **25% complete** for a production-ready restaurant POS system. We have the basic data structures and UI framework in place, but we're missing most of the operational and advanced features that restaurants actually need to run their business.

The good news is that we've built a scalable architecture that can be extended to include all these features. The bad news is that there's still 75% of the work remaining to make this a complete, production-ready POS system.
